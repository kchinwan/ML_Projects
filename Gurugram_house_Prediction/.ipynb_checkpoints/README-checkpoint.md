# 🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction (India Gurgugram City)

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict **real estate prices** based on various property features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, area size, floor count, ratings, and more. The dataset consists of real estate listings from an Indian city. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and evaluates price predictions with key metrics like **R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).**

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends, distributions, and correlations between features and target variable.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identified relevant predictors, handled multicollinearity using **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**, and scaled data.
- **Model Building:** Used **Linear Regression** to predict property prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analyzed model performance using **MSE, R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared**.
